# Mongonna

Serverless MongoDB. What are you ... mongonna do about it?

_naming things is hard_

# Why

Atlas App Service leaves a lot to be desired. If you're using Mongo, you just kind of wanted to use Mongo the way it was intended!

# How

ES6 Proxies. Chain it all together, tell Mongonna about your Mongo Client, because it's a peer dependency and its your types. We're just the chaining and RPC call.
